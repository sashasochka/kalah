"""One of the minimax method implementation for playing Kalah.

Here is a pseudocode for Minimax algorithm.

The Minimax algorithm is going deep into the searching tree and playing for
both sides: the player and his/her opponent. When it expands a node for the 
player it needs to take into account a possible answer of opponent and vice 
versa.

To become familiar with this method you must understand a simple idea:
    We suppose that our opponent is a smart guy and he/she makes always the
    optimal moves.
 
There are several main functions in the pseudocode below:
    
    Minimax-Decision: starts to build a searching tree with creation of a 
        root node and generating its neighbors // in the class MinMaxMethod 
        below this function is called make_move
    Max-Value: returns heuristic function value for a node in which the player 
        makes the move; the corresponded function in the class is _max_value
    Min-Value: returns heuristic function value for a node where the opponent 
        makes the move; the corresponded function in the class is _min_value
    Terminal-Test: checks if a current state could be expanded or not; the
        corresponded function in the class is _terminal_test
    Utility: calculates an estimation of who will win probably in a specific
        state; corresponded function in the class is _utility

    def Minimax-Decision( state ):
        neighborhood = state.get_all_neighbors( )
        best_value, best_neighbor = -float('inf'), None
        for neighbor in neighborhood:
            neighbor_value = min_value( neighbor.get_state( ) )
            if best_value < neighbor_value :
                best_value, best_neighbor = neighbor_value, neighbor
        return best_neighbor.action( )
        
    def Max-Value( state ):
        if Terminal-Test( state ):
            return Utility( state )
        max_value = -float('inf')
        neighborhood = state.get_all_neighbors( )
        for neighbor in neighborhood:
            max_value = max( max_value, Min-Value( neighbor ) )
        return max_value
        
    def Min-Value( state ):
        if Terminal-Test( state ):
            return Utility( state )
        min_value = float('inf')
        neighborhood = state.get_all_neighbors( )
        for neighbor in neighborhood:
            min_value = min( min_value, Max-Value( neighbor ) )
        return min_value
        
Tips of how to create your own minimax algorithm.

    The structure of the algorithm is the same for different games. There are 
    two points where all decisions are made:
        1) When deciding to terminate a state (node). Look up _terminal_test
        function.
        2) How to estimate state's scores if a state is not a finishing one.
        Look up _utility function.
